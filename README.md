Users can choose Hexbin or Scatter to toggle between the views of general field goal percentage and each shot the player made in the 2018-2019 season. There is also a button to toggle showing tooltips when the user hovers over a certain section. A search functionality is currently under implementation. For now, in order for a user to change searching another player, go to `Main.js` and change relevant sections to realize the functionality.
